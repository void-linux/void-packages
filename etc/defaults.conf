# Please also use ${FOO} style for shell variables because some parsers

# [OPTIONAL]
# Linker flags passed to the compiler. By default we use --as-needed to
# avoid linking extra libraries into binaries. See the following link

# [OPTIONAL]
# Enable or disable global package build options, these options apply
# to all packages that support the matching options.
