# [REQUIRED]
# Directory where the xbps-src GIT repository is stored. This is
# required to be mounted in the chroot. You shouldn't need to modify this
# one unless your xbps-packages git repo has been moved to another path.

# [OPTIONAL]
# Host directory to be (bind) mounted into the chroot (masterdir) containing
# directories for downloaded cached packages from xbps-bin(8), packages
# created by xbps-src, downloaded source distribution tarballs, etc.
#
# Basically your directory will contain this structure:
#
# 	/dir
# 	|_ /binpkgs
# 	|_ /repocache
# 	|_ /sources
#
# When created, those names are constants, so you cannot change them, even
# they are case sensitive.
#
# NOTE: You must create your toplevel /dir yourself

# [OPTIONAL]
# Compilation flags for C and C++.

# [OPTIONAL]
# Enable or disable ccache when building packages.

# [OPTIONAL]
# Linker flags passed to the compiler. By default we use --as-needed to

# Install required package dependencies from binary packages, through
# binary package repositories as specified in the XBPS repositories.plist

# Only dependencies for non bootstrap packages will be installed.
# Make sure that you modify the repositories.plist file from:
#
# XBPS >= 0.10.0:
# 	<masterdir>/usr/local/etc/xbps/repositories.plist.
# XBPS < 0.10.0:
# 	<masterdir>/usr/local/etc/xbps-conf.plist
