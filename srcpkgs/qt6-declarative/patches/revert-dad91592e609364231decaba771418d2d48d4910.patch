Reverts the patch described below. It breaks qtdeclarative build
in very mysterious ways, like:

Subject: [PATCH] Doc: Demonstrate finding some private modules

Explicitly finding a private module was not strictly required in Qt
6.9 and older. This patch adds a small demonstration to some snippets,
to show how to find QmlPrivate/QuickPrivate. This might be helpful
for users who're scratching their heads when their previously-working
project now fails to build in Qt 6.10.
