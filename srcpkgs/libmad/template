 MAD (libmad) is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently
 supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies,
 as well as the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three audio layers
 (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.

 MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it
 should be backward compatible with such streams) nor does it
 currently support AAC.

 MAD has the following special features:

  - 24-bit PCM output
  - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
  - completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
  - distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)

 Because MAD provides full 24-bit PCM output, applications using
 MAD are able to produce high quality audio. Even when the output
 device supports only 16-bit PCM, applications can use the extra
 resolution to increase the audible dynamic range through the use
 of dithering or noise shaping."
