 User-mode Linux is a port of the Linux kernel to its own system call interface.
 It provides a kind of virtual machine, which runs Linux as a user process under
 another Linux kernel. This is useful for kernel development, sandboxing,
 jailing, experimentation, and many other things.

 This package contains userspace utilities for use with User-mode Linux,
 including uml_mconsole, uml_moo, uml_switch, uml_net and tunctl."
