    Fix memory corruption in PMAP_CALLIT code
    
     - A PMAP_CALLIT call comes in on IPv4 UDP
     - rpcbind duplicates the caller's address to a netbuf and stores it in
       FINFO[0].caller_addr. caller_addr->buf now points to a memory region A
       with a size of 16 bytes
     - rpcbind forwards the call to the local service, receives a reply
     - when processing the reply, it does this in xprt_set_caller:
         xprt->xp_rtaddr = *FINFO[0].caller_addr
       It sends out the reply, and then frees the netbuf caller_addr and
       caller_addr.buf.
       However, it does not clear xp_rtaddr, so xp_rtaddr.buf now refers
       to memory region A, which is free.
     - When the next call comes in on the UDP/IPv4 socket, svc_dg_recv will
       be called, which will set xp_rtaddr to the client's address.
       It will reuse the buffer inside xp_rtaddr, ie it will write a
       sockaddr_in to region A
    
    Some time down the road, an incoming TCP connection is accepted,
    allocating a fresh SVCXPRT. The memory region A is inside the
    new SVCXPRT
    
     - While processing the TCP call, another UDP call comes in, again
       overwriting region A with the client's address
     - TCP client closes connection. In svc_destroy, we now trip over
       the garbage left in region A
    
    We ran into the case where a commercial scanner was triggering
    occasional rpcbind segfaults. The core file that was captured showed
    a corrupted xprt->xp_netid pointer that was really a sockaddr_in.
