===============================================================================
Location of the configuration file used by the monit service has changed
from '/etc/monit/monitrc' to '/etc/monitrc', as this is in line with upstream.

Consequently /etc/monit/monitrc has been deprecated and will stop working in a
future version.

Migration can be done by moving /etc/monit/monitrc to /etc/monitrc.
