Subject: [PATCH 03/18] Require static native libraries when linking static
 executables

On ELF targets like Linux, gcc/ld will create a dynamically-linked
executable without warning, even when passed `-static`, when asked to
link to a `.so`. Avoid this confusing and unintended behavior by always
using the static version of libraries when trying to link static
executables.

Fixes #54243
