    TERM AND TERMINATION. This Agreement is effective upon Subscriber’s assent to its terms and conditions in the manner specified above and shall continue for the agreed-upon subscription period set forth in the Order Form and any renewals unless otherwise terminated as provided hereunder. Spearstone may terminate this Agreement immediately upon Subscriber’s breach of the obligations set forth in Sections 2, 5 or 10 of the Agreement or in the event of Subscriber’s bankruptcy, insolvency or equivalent circumstance. Spearstone may also terminate this Agreement if Subscriber breaches any other material term of this Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days of notice thereof. Upon any such termination, Spearstone may immediately cease providing the Services, and Subscriber agrees to promptly delete all copies of the Client Software and the Documentation, and any portions thereof, from the computer(s) on which they are installed, destroy all such copies and verify such actions to Spearstone in writing.

     
    CONFIDENTIALITY. By virtue of this Agreement, the parties may have access to information that is confidential to one another (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes, without limitation, the Client Software, the terms and pricing under this Agreement and all information clearly identified as confidential or reasonably deemed to be confidential based on the circumstances and industry practices.
     
    A party’s Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other party; (b) was in the other party’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the other party either directly or indirectly from the disclosing party; (c) is lawfully disclosed to the other party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; or (d) is independently developed by the other party.
     
    The parties agree to hold each other’s Confidential Information in confidence during the term of this Agreement and thereafter. The parties agree, unless required by law, not to make each other’s Confidential Information available in any form to any third party for any purpose other than the implementation of this Agreement. Each party agrees to take all reasonable steps to ensure that Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the terms of this Agreement. Each party agrees that remedies at law may not be adequate to protect the rights of the other party under this Section 10 and that a non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce such rights.

     
    INDEMNITY. Subscriber agrees to indemnify Spearstone and hold it harmless with respect to any and all claims, causes of action or damages arising as a result of Subscriber’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

     
    GOVERNMENT USE/EXPORT ASSURANCES. Any Client Software or Services obtained from Spearstone for or on behalf of the United States of America or its agencies (“U.S. Government”), is provided with restricted rights. Use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in DFARS 252.227-7013 (Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software) or 46 CFR 52.227-19 (Commercial Computer Software Restricted Rights), as applicable. Manufacturer is Spearstone, LLC, 333 South 520 West Suite 180, Lindon, UT 84042. Subscriber may not download or otherwise export or re-export the Client Software or any underlying information or technology except in full compliance with all United States and other applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation, the United States Export Administration Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and any regulations related thereto. Any transfer of technical data outside the United States by any means, including the Internet, is an export that is subject to export control requirements under United States law. By downloading, installing or using the Client Software or Services, Subscriber agrees to the foregoing and Subscriber represents and warrants that Subscriber is not located in, under the control of or a national or resident of any prohibited country or territory.

     
    ASSIGNMENT. Subscriber may not assign any rights under this Agreement to another party without Spearstone’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such unauthorized assignment shall be void. Spearstone may assign this Agreement to any successor or affiliate.

     
    USER INFORMATION. The Spearstone Privacy Policy explains how Spearstone collects and uses Personal Information. You consent to Spearstone’s use of your Personal Information under the terms of the Spearstone Privacy Policy.

     
    BILLING. Both Monthly and Annual plans are charged for an initial quota of devices, the higher of the number of devices selected upon signup or actual installations in the first month. Monthly plans adjust up and down after reaching their initial quota, based on the devices active in the preceding month. Annual plans that exceed their quota are charged a prorated amount so all devices renew on the account’s anniversary. Fluctuations below the “high-water” mark are not re-billed. Annual renewals are charged based on the number of active devices renewed.

     
    CANCELLATION POLICY. Subscribers may cancel their service subscription either via a “Cancel Account” feature in their account, or by making a request to Customer Support. In either case, the customer will receive an email confirming their cancellation, which represents their proof of cancellation in the event of any dispute. No further charges will occur after a cancellation request.

     
    REFUND POLICY. Spearstone will refund subscription renewal charges upon requests made to Customer Support within 10 days of a monthly subscription’s renewal charge, and within 30 days of an annual subscription’s renewal charge. In either case, the customer will receive an email confirming their refund, which represents their proof of agreement to refund in the event of any dispute.

     
    MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to provisions pertaining to conflicts of law. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed stricken from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall be enforced in accordance with their terms. In the absence of a written agreement duly executed by Subscriber and Spearstone that specifically supersedes or amends the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement is the complete agreement between Subscriber and Spearstone with respect to the Client Software and the Services. The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent default or breach. Except for actions of nonpayment or breach of Spearstone’s proprietary rights in the Client Software and the Services as well as actions of breach of Sections 2, 5 or 10, no action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one year after the cause of action has occurred.
