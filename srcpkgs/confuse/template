 libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the terms
 of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports sections and (lists of)
 values (strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), as well as
 some other features (such as single/double-quoted strings, environment
 variable expansion, functions and nested include statements). It makes it
 very easy to add configuration file capability to a program using a simple
 API.

 The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library
 with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick
 to integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg before, but its
 name was changed to not confuse itself with other similar libraries."
