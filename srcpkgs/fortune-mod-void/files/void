Don't ask stupid questions when the main dev is in there,

you guys are pretty smart, I understand this, may be you
	can give me part of your smartness?

 xtraeme: time to make the daily sports session, cya
dominikh: carry a crate of beer up the stairs? :P
%
Digit: maybe we could just set you as the outter edge,
       and make an easy one-liner code of conduct for #xbps.
       "dont be worse than Ypnose."
%
dominikh: void keeps on rolling… just like your mom
%
great work though
Void is usually updated before we start writing the libressl release notes
%
People just need training to understand my sentences.

%
dominikh: wtf.  didn't do a thing and all of a sudden /dev/null is 600
chris2: safer that way :P
        is it also 52222G large? :D
%
I've used Void Linux for some times now.
The only thing that breaks sometimes it's the package manager and its
build tree.
%
Gottox: I considered a revert, but xtraeme rather waits for a new release :D
	The good old german saying: "Vorwärts immer, Rückwärts nimmer!" :D
%
chris2: I'm somewhat tempted to propose AF_TWITTER -

2018: Gottox: hmm... using the github api over 4g is kinda ugly.
              Somebody with the same ipv4 seems to hit the rate limit...
