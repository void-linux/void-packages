.SS Install
.PP
Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.
.PP
Download (http://rclone.org/downloads/) the relevant binary.
.PP
Or alternatively if you have Go installed use
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
go\ get\ github.com/ncw/rclone
\f[]
.fi
.PP
and this will build the binary in \f[C]$GOPATH/bin\f[].
If you have built rclone before then you will want to update its
dependencies first with this (remove \f[C]\-f\f[] if using go < 1.4)
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

.PP
See the Usage section (http://rclone.org/docs/) of the docs for how to
use rclone, or run \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[].

.SS Configure
.PP
First you\[aq]ll need to configure rclone.
As the object storage systems have quite complicated authentication
these are kept in a config file \f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[] in your home
directory by default.
(You can use the \f[C]\-\-config\f[] option to choose a different config
file.)
.PP
The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ config
\f[]
.fi

.SS Usage
.PP
Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.
.PP
Its syntax is like this
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Syntax:\ [options]\ subcommand\ <parameters>\ <parameters...>
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg "drive:myfolder"
to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.
.PP
You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.
.SS Subcommands
.SS rclone copy source:path dest:path
.PP
Copy the source to the destination.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Doesn\[aq]t delete files from the destination.
.SS rclone sync source:path dest:path
.PP
Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn\[aq]t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if
necessary.
Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
\f[C]\-\-dry\-run\f[] flag.
.SS rclone ls [remote:path]
.PP
List all the objects in the the path with size and path.
.SS rclone lsd [remote:path]
.PP
List all directories/containers/buckets in the the path.
.SS rclone lsl [remote:path]
.PP
List all the objects in the the path with modification time, size and
path.
.SS rclone md5sum [remote:path]
.PP
Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.
This is in the same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.
.SS rclone mkdir remote:path
.PP
Make the path if it doesn\[aq]t already exist
.SS rclone rmdir remote:path
.PP
Remove the path.
Note that you can\[aq]t remove a path with objects in it, use purge for
that.
.SS rclone purge remote:path
.PP
Remove the path and all of its contents.
.SS rclone check source:path dest:path
.PP
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
It compares sizes and MD5SUMs and prints a report of files which
don\[aq]t match.
It doesn\[aq]t alter the source or destination.
.SS rclone config
.PP
Enter an interactive configuration session.
.SS rclone help
.PP
Prints help on rclone commands and options.
.SS Server Side Copy
.PP
Drive, S3, Dropbox, Swift and Google Cloud Storage support server side
copy.
.PP
This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone
won\[aq]t download all the files and re\-upload them; it will instruct
the server to copy them in place.
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ s3:oldbucket\ s3:newbucket
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will copy the contents of \f[C]oldbucket\f[] to \f[C]newbucket\f[]
without downloading and re\-uploading.
.PP
Remotes which don\[aq]t support server side copy (eg local)
\f[B]will\f[] download and re\-upload in this case.
.PP
Server side copies are used with \f[C]sync\f[] and \f[C]copy\f[] and
will be identified in the log when using the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
.PP
Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.
.PP
This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ remote:current\-backup\ remote:previous\-backup
rclone\ sync\ /path/to/files\ remote:current\-backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Options
.PP
Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.
.PP
Options which use TIME use the go time parser.
A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "\-1.5h" or
"2h45m".
Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
.PP
Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.
However a suffix of \f[C]k\f[] for kBytes, \f[C]M\f[] for MBytes and
\f[C]G\f[] for GBytes may be used.
These are the binary units, eg 2\f[B]10, 2\f[]20, 2**30 respectively.
.SS \-\-bwlimit=SIZE
.PP
Bandwidth limit in kBytes/s, or use suffix k|M|G.
The default is \f[C]0\f[] which means to not limit bandwidth.
.PP
For example to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use
\f[C]\-\-bwlimit\ 10M\f[]
.PP
This only limits the bandwidth of the data transfer, it doesn\[aq]t
limit the bandwith of the directory listings etc.
.SS \-\-checkers=N
.PP
The number of checkers to run in parallel.
Checkers do the equality checking of files during a sync.
For some storage systems (eg s3, swift, dropbox) this can take a
significant amount of time so they are run in parallel.
.PP
The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.
.SS \-c, \-\-checksum
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check MD5SUM and size to determine
if files are equal.
.PP
This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
MD5SUM on the object which include swift, s3, drive, and google cloud
storage.
.PP
Eg \f[C]rclone\ \-\-checksum\ sync\ s3:/bucket\ swift:/bucket\f[] would
run much quicker than without the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS \-\-config=CONFIG_FILE
.PP
Specify the location of the rclone config file.
Normally this is in your home directory as a file called
\f[C]\&.rclone.conf\f[].
If you run \f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and look at the help for the
\f[C]\-\-config\f[] option you will see where the default location is
for you.
Use this flag to override the config location, eg
\f[C]rclone\ \-\-config=".myconfig"\ .config\f[].
.SS \-\-contimeout=TIME
.PP
Set the connection timeout.
This should be in go time format which looks like \f[C]5s\f[] for 5
seconds, \f[C]10m\f[] for 10 minutes, or \f[C]3h30m\f[].
.PP
The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.
It is \f[C]1m\f[] by default.
.SS \-n, \-\-dry\-run
.PP
Do a trial run with no permanent changes.
Use this in combination with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag to see what rclone
would do without actually doing it.
Useful when setting up the \f[C]sync\f[] command.
.SS \-\-log\-file=FILE
.PP
Log all of rclone\[aq]s output to FILE.
This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination
with the \f[C]\-v\f[] flag.
.SS \-\-modify\-window=TIME
.PP
When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1ns\f[] unless this is overridden by a remote.
For example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
\f[C]1s\f[] by default.
.PP
This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.
.SS \-q, \-\-quiet
.PP
Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message.
If you set this flag it will make as little output as possible.
.SS \-\-size\-only
.PP
Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal.
If you set this flag then rclone will check only the size.
.PP
This can be useful transferring files from dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn\[aq]t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.
.PP
When using this flag, rclone won\[aq]t update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.
.SS \-\-stats=TIME
.PP
Rclone will print stats at regular intervals to show its progress.
.PP
This sets the interval.
.PP
The default is \f[C]1m\f[].
Use 0 to disable.
.SS \-\-timeout=TIME
.PP
This sets the IO idle timeout.
If a transfer has started but then becomes idle for this long it is
considered broken and disconnected.
.PP
The default is \f[C]5m\f[].
Set to 0 to disable.
.SS \-\-transfers=N
.PP
The number of file transfers to run in parallel.
It can sometimes be useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote
is giving a lot of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and
a fast remote.
.PP
The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.
.SS \-v, \-\-verbose
.PP
If you set this flag, rclone will become very verbose telling you about
every file it considers and transfers.
.PP
Very useful for debugging.
.SS \-V, \-\-version
.PP
Prints the version number
.SS Developer options
.PP
These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.
There are also some more remote specific options which aren\[aq]t
documented here which are used for testing.
These start with remote name eg \f[C]\-\-drive\-test\-option\f[].
.SS \-\-cpuprofile=FILE
.PP
Write cpu profile to file.
This can be analysed with \f[C]go\ tool\ pprof\f[].
.SH Overview of cloud storage systems
.PP
Each cloud storage system is slighly different.
Rclone attempts to provide a unified interface to them, but some
underlying differences show through.

.SS MD5SUM
.PP
The cloud storage system supports MD5SUMs of the objects.
This is used if available when transferring data as an integrity check
and can be specifically used with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag in
syncs and in the \f[C]check\f[] command.
.SS ModTime
.PP
The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync.
If not then only the size will be checked by default, though the MD5SUM
can be checked with the \f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.PP
All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.
.SS Case Sensitive
.PP
If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, eg \f[C]file.txt\f[] and
\f[C]FILE.txt\f[].
If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn\[aq]t
possible.
.PP
This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system.
The symptom of this is that no matter how many times you run the sync it
never completes fully.
.PP
The local filesystem may or may not be case sensitive depending on OS.
.IP \[bu] 2
Windows \- usuall case insensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
OSX \- usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
sensitive
.IP \[bu] 2
Linux \- usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
systems (eg FAT formatted USB keys)
.PP
Most of the time this doesn\[aq]t cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.
.SS Duplicate files
.PP
If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.
.PP
This confuses rclone greatly when syncing.
.SS Google Drive
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]drive:path\f[]
.PP
Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]drive:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.
\f[C]rclone\ config\f[] walks you through it.
.PP
Here is an example of how to make a remote called \f[C]remote\f[].
First run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\ rclone\ config
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

.fi
.PP
Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.
This is on \f[C]http://127.0.0.1:53682/\f[] and this it may require you
to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall, or use
manual mode.
.PP
You can then use it like this,
.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ lsd\ remote:
\f[]
.fi
.PP

.PP

.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Modified time
.PP
Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.
.SS Revisions
.PP
Google drive stores revisions of files.
When you upload a change to an existing file to google drive using
rclone it will create a new revision of that file.
.PP
Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was
.IP \[bu] 2
They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
.IP \[bu] 2
They do not count towards a user storage quota.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
By default rclone will delete files permanently when requested.
If sending them to the trash is required instead then use the
\f[C]\-\-drive\-use\-trash\f[] flag.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.
This causes rclone to be limited to transferring about 2 files per
second only.
Individual files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but
lots of small files can take a long time.
.SS Amazon S3
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:bucket/path/to/dir\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of making an s3 configuration.
First run

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Amz\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch accurate
to 1 ns.
.SS Multipart uploads
.PP
rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5GB.
Note that files uploaded with multipart upload don\[aq]t have an MD5SUM.
.SS Buckets and Regions
.PP
With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (\f[C]rclone\ lsd\f[]) using any
region, but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region
it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you will get an
error,
\f[C]incorrect\ region,\ the\ bucket\ is\ not\ in\ \[aq]XXX\[aq]\ region\f[].
.SS Ceph
.PP
Ceph is an object storage system which presents an Amazon S3 interface.
.PP
To use rclone with ceph, you need to set the following parameters in the
config.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
access_key_id\ =\ Whatever
secret_access_key\ =\ Whatever
endpoint\ =\ https://ceph.endpoint.goes.here/
region\ =\ other\-v2\-signature
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Note also that Ceph sometimes puts \f[C]/\f[] in the passwords it gives
users.
If you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will
get a JSON blob with the \f[C]/\f[] escaped as \f[C]\\/\f[].
Make sure you only write \f[C]/\f[] in the secret access key.
.PP
Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
{
\ \ \ \ "user_id":\ "xxx",
\ \ \ \ "display_name":\ "xxxx",
\ \ \ \ "keys":\ [
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "user":\ "xxx",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "access_key":\ "xxxxxx",
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "secret_key":\ "xxxxxx\\/xxxx"
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ }
\ \ \ \ ],
}
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the \f[C]/\f[] as
\f[C]\\/\f[], so if you use the secret key as \f[C]xxxxxx/xxxx\f[] it
will work fine.
.SS Swift
.PP
Swift refers to Openstack Object
Storage (http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-storage/).
Commercial implementations of that being:
.IP \[bu] 2
Rackspace Cloud Files (http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/)
.IP \[bu] 2
Memset Memstore (http://www.memset.com/cloud/storage/)
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:container\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[]
for the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
\f[C]remote:container/path/to/dir\f[].
.PP
Here is an example of making a swift configuration.
First run

.SS Modified time
.PP
The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
\f[C]X\-Object\-Meta\-Mtime\f[] as floating point since the epoch
accurate to 1 ns.
.PP
This is a defacto standard (used in the official python\-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.
.SS Dropbox
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:path\f[]
.PP
Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, eg
\f[C]remote:directory/subdirectory\f[].
.PP
The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.

.SS Modified time and MD5SUMs
.PP
Dropbox doesn\[aq]t have the capability of storing modification times or
MD5SUMs so syncs will effectively have the \f[C]\-\-size\-only\f[] flag
set.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Dropbox is case sensitive so you can\[aq]t have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
There are some file names such as \f[C]thumbs.db\f[] which Dropbox
can\[aq]t store.
There is a full list of them in the "Ignored Files" section of this
document (https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).
Rclone will issue an error message
\f[C]File\ name\ disallowed\ \-\ not\ uploading\f[] if it attempt to
upload one of those file names, but the sync won\[aq]t fail.
.SS Google Cloud Storage
.PP
Paths are specified as \f[C]remote:bucket\f[] (or \f[C]remote:\f[] for
the \f[C]lsd\f[] command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode.
This only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
get back the verification code.

Once configured you can then use \f[C]rclone\f[] like this,

.fi
.PP
To copy a local directory to an Amazon cloud drive directory called
backup
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ copy\ /home/source\ remote:backup
\f[]
.fi
.SS Modified time and MD5SUMs
.PP
Amazon cloud drive doesn\[aq]t allow modification times to be changed
via the API so these won\[aq]t be accurate or used for syncing.
.PP
It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
\f[C]\-\-checksum\f[] flag.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.
Amazon don\[aq]t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to
empty the trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon\[aq]s
apps or via the Amazon cloud drive website.
.SS Limitations
.PP
Note that Amazon cloud drive is case sensitive so you can\[aq]t have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".
.PP
Amazon cloud drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the
sync (429 errors).
rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by default (see
\f[C]\-\-retries\f[] flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.
.SS Local Filesystem
.PP
Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg
\f[C]/path/to/wherever\f[], so
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ /home/source\ /tmp/destination
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Will sync \f[C]/home/source\f[] to \f[C]/tmp/destination\f[]
.PP
These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake, but
it is probably easier not to.
.SS Modified time
.PP
Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS.
Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second on OS X.
.SS Filenames
.PP
Filenames are expected to be encoded in UTF\-8 on disk.
This is the normal case for Windows and OS X.
There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF\-8 encoded files names.
.PP
If an invalid (non\-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid caracters will
be replaced with the unicode replacement character, \[aq]�\[aq].
\f[C]rclone\f[] will emit a debug message in this case (use \f[C]\-v\f[]
to see), eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Local\ file\ system\ at\ .:\ Replacing\ invalid\ UTF\-8\ characters\ in\ "gro\\xdf"

.SS Bugs and Limitations
.SS Empty directories are left behind / not created
.PP
With remotes that have a concept of directory, eg Local and Drive, empty
directories may be left behind, or not created when one was expected.
.PP
This is because rclone doesn\[aq]t have a concept of a directory \- it
only works on objects.
Most of the object storage systems can\[aq]t actually store a directory
so there is nowhere for rclone to store anything about directories.
.PP
You can work round this to some extent with the\f[C]purge\f[] command
which will delete everything under the path, \f[B]inluding\f[] empty
directories.
.PP
This may be fixed at some point in Issue
#100 (https://github.com/ncw/rclone/issues/100)
.SS Directory timestamps aren\[aq]t preserved
.PP
For the same reason as the above, rclone doesn\[aq]t have a concept of a
directory \- it only works on objects, therefore it can\[aq]t preserve
the timestamps of directories.
.SS Frequently Asked Questions
.SS Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands
.PP
Yes they do.
All the rclone commands (eg \f[C]sync\f[], \f[C]copy\f[] etc) will work
on all the remote storage systems.
.SS Can I copy the config from one machine to another
.PP
Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.
If you want to find this file, the simplest way is to run
\f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] and look at the help for the \f[C]\-\-config\f[]
flag which will tell you where it is.
Eg,
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ rclone\ \-h
Sync\ files\ and\ directories\ to\ and\ from\ local\ and\ remote\ object\ stores\ \-\ v1.18.
[snip]
Options:
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\-bwlimit=0:\ Bandwidth\ limit\ in\ kBytes/s,\ or\ use\ suffix\ k|M|G
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\-checkers=8:\ Number\ of\ checkers\ to\ run\ in\ parallel.
\ \ \-c,\ \-\-checksum=false:\ Skip\ based\ on\ checksum\ &\ size,\ not\ mod\-time\ &\ size
\ \ \ \ \ \ \-\-config="/home/user/.rclone.conf":\ Config\ file.
[snip]
\f[]
.fi
.PP
So in this config the config file can be found in
\f[C]/home/user/.rclone.conf\f[].
.PP
Just copy that to the equivalent place in the destination (run
\f[C]rclone\ \-h\f[] above again on the destination machine if not
sure).
.SS Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3
.PP
Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.
.PP
Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.
.PP
The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).
.PP
Eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rclone\ sync\ drive:Folder\ s3:bucket
\f[]
.fi
.SS Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time
.PP
You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerA
Server\ B>\ rclone\ sync\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:ServerB
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Server\ A>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
Server\ B>\ rclone\ copy\ /tmp/whatever\ remote:Backup
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make
duplicates.
.SS Why doesn\[aq]t rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like
rsync?
.PP
Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.
This means that you can see the files you upload as expected using
alternative access methods (eg using the Google Drive web interface).
There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk and objects
created in the cloud storage system.
.PP
Cloud storage systems (at least none I\[aq]ve come across yet) don\[aq]t
support partially uploading an object.
You can\[aq]t take an existing object, and change some bytes in the
middle of it.
.PP
It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.
.PP
All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.
However to make this work efficiently this would require storing a
significant amount of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of
files to objects.
.SS Can rclone do bi\-directional sync?
.PP
No, not at present.
rclone only does uni\-directional sync from A \-> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives \- it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.
