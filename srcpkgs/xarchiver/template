 Xarchiver is a lightweight desktop independent archive manager built with
 the GTK+2 toolkit. It was my intention to develop a simple GUI which could
 be used with any desktop environment and would operate using the command
 line rather than API calls. Xarchiver has been designed from the ground up
 to be fast and easy-to-use. Its user interface is clean and intuitive, and
 does not include any confusing or useless options."
