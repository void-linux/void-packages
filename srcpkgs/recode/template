 Free recode converts files between character sets and usages. When exact
 transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
 characters or fall back on approximations. This program recognizes or
 produces nearly 300 different character sets and is able to transliterate
 files between almost any pair. Most RFC 1345 character sets, and all
 libiconv character sets, are supported."
