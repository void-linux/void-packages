 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers
 more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its
 concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out
 of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine
 code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time
 reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like
 a dynamically typed, interpreted language."
