 The xdg-utils package is a set of simple scripts that provide basic
 desktop integration functions for any Free Desktop, such as Linux.

 They are intended to provide a set of defacto standards. This means that:

  * Third party software developers can rely on these xdg-utils for
    all of their simple integration needs.

  * Developers of desktop environments can make sure that their
    environments are well supported.

    If a desktop developer wants to be certain that their environment
    functions with all third party software, then can simply make sure
    that these utilities work properly in their environment.  This will
    hopefully mean that 'third tier' window managers such as XFCE and
    Blackbox can reach full parity with Gnome and KDE in terms of third
    party ISV support.

  * Distribution vendors can provide custom versions of these utilities

 If a distribution vendor wishes to have unusual systems, they can
 provide custom scripts, and the third party software should still
 continue to work."
