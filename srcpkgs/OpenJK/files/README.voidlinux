OpenJK requires a copy of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy.
You can also use this for Jedi Outcast (singleplayer only), which requires a copy as well.
The default folder that the game will search for files is

	Jedi Academy: ~/.local/share/openjk
	Jedi Outcast: ~/.local/share/openjo

You can easily link your game files by doing the following:

	cd ~/.local/share/openjk
	mkdir base
	ln -s /path/to/game/GameData/base/* base
