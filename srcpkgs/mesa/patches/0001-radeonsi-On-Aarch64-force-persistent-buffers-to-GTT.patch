Subject: [PATCH] radeonsi: On Aarch64 force persistent buffers to GTT

This fixes a glamore corruption issue on the HoneyComb and by
internet reports should also fix problems seen on Huaweii
Kunpeng hardware.

The root cause of the corruption needs to be worked out, but
this patch also adds a noticable performance improvement. The
aquarium webgl demo under chromium increases from 39-49 FPS
when 5000 fish being rendered is selected.  Glmark scores also
improve by ~200 with no specific tests showing any regression.
