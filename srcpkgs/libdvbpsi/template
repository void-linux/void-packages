 lbdvbpsi is a simple library designed for decoding and generation of MPEG TS
 and DVB PSI tables.

 Current features

  Program Association Table (PAT), decoder and generator.
  Program Map Table (PMT), decoder and generator.
  All MPEG 2 descriptors, decoders and generators.

 The libdvbpsi is part of the VideoLAN project, a full MPEG2
 client/server solution. The libdvbpsi can also be used with extra
 programs that need DVB and PSI decoders and generators.

 The VideoLAN team decided to write the libdvbpsi to make the VideoLAN
 Client and the VideoLAN Server capable of demultiplexing a satellite
 DVB stream. The library aims at making it easy to decode PSI tables
 (such as PAT, PMT etc.) present in a TS/DVB stream."
