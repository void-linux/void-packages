For MIDI playing and sequencing, WildMidi requires a patchset (or sound fonts).

The 'freepats' package provides a patchset compatible with TiMidity and WildMidi, as well as
an example configuration file that can be copied to /etc/wildmidi/wildmidi.cfg

Please refer to the wildmidi.cfg(5) manpage for more details.
