 $pkgname reports information about x86 and ia64 hardware as described in
 the system BIOS according to the SMBIOS/DMI standard. This information
 typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number,
 BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying
 level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer.

 This will often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion
 slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of
 I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB)."
