# NOTE: don't run either:
#	make preset-bin
#	make all-bin
#	rime_deployer --build output
#
# Although, it'll save our users some time on first start up
# However, it's not fully compatible, at least native x86_64-musl
# and armv7l-musl artifacts differ.
#
# And the binary files will be recompiled if librime is updated.
