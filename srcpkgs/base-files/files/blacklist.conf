# Listing a module here prevents the hotplug scripts from loading it.
# Usually that'd be so that some other driver will bind it instead,
# no matter which driver happens to get probed first.Â  Sometimes user
# mode tools can also control driver binding.

# Syntax: driver name alone (without any spaces) on a line. Other
