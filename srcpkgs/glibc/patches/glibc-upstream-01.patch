Subject: [PATCH 01] nptl: Fix pthread_rwlock_try*lock stalls (Bug 23844)

For a full analysis of both the pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() stall
and the pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() stall see:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23844#c14

In the pthread_rwlock_trydlock() function we fail to inspect for
PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED in __wrphase_futex and wake the waiting
readers.

In the pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function we write 1 to
__wrphase_futex and loose the setting of the PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED
bit, again failing to wake waiting readers during unlock.

The fix in the case of pthread_rwlock_trydlock() is to check for
PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED and wake the readers.

The fix in the case of pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() is to only write
1 to __wrphase_futex if we installed the write phase, since all other
readers would be spinning waiting for this step.

We add two new tests, one exercises the stall for
pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() which is easy to exercise, and one exercises
the stall for pthread_rwlock_trydlock() which is harder to exercise.

The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() test fails consistently without the fix,
and passes after. The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() test fails roughly
5-10% of the time without the fix, and passes all the time after.

+
+   --- Analysis of pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() stall ---
+   A read lock begins to execute.
+
+   In __pthread_rwlock_rdlock_full:
+
+   We can attempt a read lock, but find that the lock is
+   in a write phase (PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE, or WP-bit
+   is set), and the lock is held by a primary writer
+   (PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCKED is set). In this case we must
+   wait for explicit hand over from the writer to us or
+   one of the other waiters. The read lock threads are
+   about to execute:
+
+   341   r = (atomic_fetch_add_acquire (&rwlock->__data.__readers,
+   342                                  (1 << PTHREAD_RWLOCK_READER_SHIFT))
+   343        + (1 << PTHREAD_RWLOCK_READER_SHIFT));
+
+   An unlock beings to execute.
+
+   Then in __pthread_rwlock_wrunlock:
+
+   547   unsigned int r = atomic_load_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__readers);
+   ...
+   549   while (!atomic_compare_exchange_weak_release
+   550          (&rwlock->__data.__readers, &r,
+   551           ((r ^ PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCKED)
+   552            ^ ((r >> PTHREAD_RWLOCK_READER_SHIFT) == 0 ? 0
+   553               : PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE))))
+   554     {
+   ...
+   556     }
+
+   We clear PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCKED, and if there are
+   no readers so we leave the lock in PTHRAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE.
+
+   Back in the read lock.
+
+   The read lock adjusts __readres as above.
+
+   383   while ((r & PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE) != 0
+   384          && (r & PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCKED) == 0)
+   385     {
+   ...
+   390       if (atomic_compare_exchange_weak_acquire (&rwlock->__data.__readers, &r,
+   391                                                 r ^ PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE))
+   392         {
+
+   And then attemps to start the read phase.
+
+   Assume there happens to be a tryrdlock at this point, noting
+   that PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCKED is clear, and PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE
+   is 1. So the try lock attemps to start the read phase.
+
+   In __pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock:
+
+    44       if ((r & PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE) == 0)
+    45         {
+   ...
+    49           if (((r & PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCKED) != 0)
+    50               && (rwlock->__data.__flags
+    51                   == PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP))
+    52             return EBUSY;
+    53           rnew = r + (1 << PTHREAD_RWLOCK_READER_SHIFT);
+    54         }
+   ...
+    89   while (!atomic_compare_exchange_weak_acquire (&rwlock->__data.__readers,
+    90       &r, rnew));
+
+   And succeeds.
+
+   Back in the write unlock:
+
+   557   if ((r >> PTHREAD_RWLOCK_READER_SHIFT) != 0)
+   558     {
+   ...
+   563       if ((atomic_exchange_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex, 0)
+   564            & PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED) != 0)
+   565         futex_wake (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex, INT_MAX, private);
+   566     }
+
+   We note that PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED is non-zero
+   and don't wake anyone. This is OK because we handed
+   over to the trylock. It will be the trylock's responsibility
+   to wake any waiters.
+
+   Back in the read lock:
+
+   The read lock fails to install PTHRAD_REWLOCK_WRPHASE as 0 because
+   the __readers value was adjusted by the trylock, and so it falls through
+   to waiting on the lock for explicit handover from either a new writer
+   or a new reader.
+
+   448           int err = futex_abstimed_wait (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex,
+   449                                          1 | PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED,
+   450                                          abstime, private);
+
+   We use PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED to indicate the futex
+   is in use.
+
+   At this point we have readers waiting on the read lock
+   to unlock. The wrlock is done. The trylock is finishing
+   the installation of the read phase.
+
+    92   if ((r & PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRPHASE) != 0)
+    93     {
+   ...
+   105       atomic_store_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex, 0);
+   106     }
+
+   The trylock does note that we were the one that
+   installed the read phase, but the comments are not
+   correct, the execution ordering above shows that
+   readers might indeed be waiting, and they are.
+
+   The atomic_store_relaxed throws away PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED,
+   and the waiting reader is never worken becuase as noted
+   above it is conditional on the futex being used.
+
+   The solution is for the trylock thread to inspect
+   PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED and wake the waiting readers.
+
+   --- Analysis of pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() stall ---

+
+   We atomically install the write phase and we take the
+   exclusive write lock.
+
+    48         {
+    49           atomic_store_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__writers_futex, 1);
+
+   We get this far.
+
+   A reader lock begins to execute.
+
+   In pthread_rwlock_rdlock:
+
+   437   for (;;)
+   438     {
+   439       while (((wpf = atomic_load_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex))

+   441         {
+   442           int private = __pthread_rwlock_get_private (rwlock);

+   447             continue;

+   450                                          abstime, private);
+
+   We are in a write phase, so the while() on line 439 is true.
+
+   The value of wpf does not have PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED set
+   since this is the first reader to lock.
+
+   The atomic operation sets wpf with PTHREAD_RELOCK_FUTEX_USED
+   on the expectation that this reader will be woken during
+   the handoff.
+
+   Back in pthread_rwlock_trywrlock:
+
+    50           atomic_store_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex, 1);
+    51           atomic_store_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__cur_writer,
+    52               THREAD_GETMEM (THREAD_SELF, tid));
+    53           return 0;
+    54         }
+   ...
+    57     }
+
+   We write 1 to __wrphase_futex discarding PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED,
+   and so in the unlock we will not awaken the waiting reader.
+
+   The solution to this is to realize that if we did not start the write
+   phase we need not write 1 or any other value to __wrphase_futex.
+   This ensures that any readers (which saw __wrphase_futex != 0) can
+   set PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED and this can be used at unlock to
+   wake them.
+
+   If we installed the write phase then all other readers are looping
+   here:
+
+   In __pthread_rwlock_rdlock_full:
+
+   437   for (;;)
+   438     {
+   439       while (((wpf = atomic_load_relaxed (&rwlock->__data.__wrphase_futex))
+   440               | PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED) == (1 | PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED))
+   441         {
+   ...
+   508     }
+
+   waiting for the write phase to be installed or removed before they
+   can begin waiting on __wrphase_futex (part of the algorithm), or
+   taking a concurrent read lock, and thus we can safely write 1 to
+   __wrphase_futex.
+
+   If we did not install the write phase then the readers may already
+   be waiting on the futex, the original writer wrote 1 to __wrphase_futex
+   as part of starting the write phase, and we cannot also write 1
+   without loosing the PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED bit.
+
+   ---
+
+   Summary for the pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() stall:
+
+   The stall is caused by pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock failing to check
+   that PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED is set in the __wrphase_futex futex
+   and then waking the futex.
+
+   The fix for bug 23844 ensures that waiters on __wrphase_futex are
+   correctly woken.  Before the fix the test stalls as readers can
+   wait forever on __wrphase_futex.  */

+   Summary for the pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() stall:
+
+   The stall is caused by pthread_rwlock_trywrlock setting
+   __wrphase_futex futex to 1 and loosing the
+   PTHREAD_RWLOCK_FUTEX_USED bit.
+
+   The fix for bug 23844 ensures that waiters on __wrphase_futex are
+   correctly woken.  Before the fix the test stalls as readers can
+   wait forever on  __wrphase_futex.  */
