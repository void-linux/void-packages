Subject: [PATCH 47] malloc: Fix tcache leak after thread destruction [BZ
 #22111]

The malloc tcache added in 2.26 will leak all of the elements remaining
in the cache and the cache structure itself when a thread exits. The
defect is that we do not set tcache_shutting_down early enough, and the
thread simply recreates the tcache and places the elements back onto a
new tcache which is subsequently lost as the thread exits (unfreed
memory). The fix is relatively simple, move the setting of
tcache_shutting_down earlier in tcache_thread_freeres. We add a test
case which uses mallinfo and some heuristics to look for unaccounted for
memory usage between the start and end of a thread start/join loop. It
is very reliable at detecting that there is a leak given the number of
iterations.  Without the fix the test will consume 122MiB of leaked
memory.
