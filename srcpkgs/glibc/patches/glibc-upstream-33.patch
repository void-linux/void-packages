Subject: [PATCH 33] x86: Fix Haswell CPU string flags (BZ#23709)

Th commit 'Disable TSX on some Haswell processors.' (2702856bf4) changed the
default flags for Haswell models.  Previously, new models were handled by the
default switch path, which assumed a Core i3/i5/i7 if AVX is available. After
the patch, Haswell models (0x3f, 0x3c, 0x45, 0x46) do not set the flags
Fast_Rep_String, Fast_Unaligned_Load, Fast_Unaligned_Copy, and
Prefer_PMINUB_for_stringop (only the TSX one).

This patch fixes it by disentangle the TSX flag handling from the memory
optimization ones.  The strstr case cited on patch now selects the
__strstr_sse2_unaligned as expected for the Haswell cpu.

Checked on x86_64-linux-gnu.

	[BZ #23709]
	* sysdeps/x86/cpu-features.c (init_cpu_features): Set TSX bits
	independently of other flags.

(cherry picked from commit c3d8dc45c9df199b8334599a6cbd98c9950dba62)
