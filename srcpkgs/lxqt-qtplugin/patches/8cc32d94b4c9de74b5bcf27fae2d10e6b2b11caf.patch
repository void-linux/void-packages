Subject: [PATCH] Do not reset widget palettes on changing style
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Generally, resetting a widget's palette from outside its code is a bad practice because the palette may have been changed for a reason.

If the custom palette of a widget needs an update when the style changes, the program itself is responsible for that; otherwise, the program has a bug â€” as in libfm-qt's places view (which I'll fix soon) and Dolphin's main view (which will never be fixed).
