This removes an invalid assumption that results in both BLARGG_LITTLE_ENDIAN
and BLARGG_BIG_ENDIAN being defined on little endian musl, as we're already
covered by __LITTLE_ENDIAN__/__BIG_ENDIAN__ (which is specified as a part
of the ELFv2 ABI itself to be always present). Glibc was not broken because
it has its own check before that.
