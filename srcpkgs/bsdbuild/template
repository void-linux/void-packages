long_desc="
 BSDBuild is a simple, self-contained and portable build system derived from
 the traditional 4.4BSD share/mk files. BSDBuild uses BSD-style makefiles,
 but without BSD make extensions (it uses standard Bourne script fragments
 instead), so the build system is portable to most operating systems and make
 flavors.

 You never need to "regenerate" your makefiles when using BSDBuild, they are
 edited directly. This is one major advantage of BSDBuild over systems which
 use generated makefiles: BSDBuild is implemented as a library.

 BSDBuild can generate Bourne-type configure scripts. The base distribution
 currently includes over 90 built-in tests for detecting and testing the
 compatibility of various software, and writing new tests is easy."
