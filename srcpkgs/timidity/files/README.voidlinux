For MIDI playing and sequencing, TiMidity requires a patchset (or sound fonts).

The 'freepats' package provides a patchset compatible with TiMidity, as well as
an example configuration file that can be copied to /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg

Please refer to the timidity.cfg(5) manpage for more details.
