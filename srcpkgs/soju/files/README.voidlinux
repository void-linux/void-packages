The system service /etc/sv/soju runs soju as system user _soju.

By default, the database will be stored in /var/db/soju/ and logs will be in
/var/log/soju/. Both directories are owned by user _soju.

To initialize the database, make sure you run sojuctl as the _soju user:

$ sudo -u _soju sojuctl -config /etc/soju/config create-user <username> -admin
