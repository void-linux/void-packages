long_desc="
 MDA-LV2 is an LV2 port of the MDA plugins by Paul Kellett. It contains 36
 high-quality plugins for a variety of tasks.

 This is a more or less faithful port of both the effects and instrument
 plugins. The only functional difference in code is to support LV2-style
 toggle ports (> 0.0 is on, rather than 0.5). All the plugins have been tested,
 and thanks to several bug fixes this collection should be more reliable than
 the original."
