Subject: Revert upstream "MDEV-24630: MY_RELAX_CPU assembly instruction upgrade"
Description:
 It was noticed that MariaDB 10.5.10 regressed and no longer built on armhf.
 For details see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=988629
 Reverting the upstream commit
 https://github.com/MariaDB/server/commit/76d2846a71a155ee2861fd52e6635e35490a9dd1
 is likely to fix it and make armhf build again.
