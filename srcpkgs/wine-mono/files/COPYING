Wine Mono contains code from several different projects, each of which has its own licensing.

Parts of Mono (mono/) are variously licensed under the GPL, LGPL, and MIT X11 licenses. All parts are available as LGPL or MIT X11 except for the following:
 * The ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib library is available as GPL with an exception (see mono/mcs/class/ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib/README). Because this library is not a replacement for any Microsoft class libraries, nor is it used by any replacements for Microsoft class libraries, I believe this is OK.
 * The TimeZoneInfo implementation for Android (mono/mcs/class/System.Core/System/TimeZoneInfo.Android.cs) is licensed as Apache 2.0. That code is not used in the Wine Mono build.
 * Parts of mcs/tools. I don't have an exhaustive list of these, but I believe the tools are used only at build time and not shipped.
 * mcs/jay is BSD-licensed.

The Visual Basic class libraries (mono-basic/) are MIT X11. The compiler is LGPL v2.

OpenTK (opentk/) is MIT X11.

Lidgren.Network (MonoGame/ThirdParty/Lidgren.Network) is MIT.

MonoGame uses GamepadConfig, Tao.Sdl, and SDL for its gamepad support. GamepadConfig has a non-free license, so gamepad support is disabled in Wine Mono to eliminate those dependencies.

MonoGame (MonoGame/) is Ms-PL.
