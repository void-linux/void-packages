Subject: [PATCH] mountd: fix segfault in add_name with newer gcc compilers
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/757835
Bug-Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1355829

I hit a segfault in add_name with a mountd built with gcc-4.9.0. Some
NULL pointer checks got reordered such that a pointer was dereferenced
before checking to see whether it was NULL. The problem was due to
nfs-utils relying on undefined behavior, which tricked gcc into assuming
that the pointer would never be NULL.

At first I assumed that this was a compiler bug, but Jakub Jelinek and
Jeff Law pointed out:

"If old is NULL, then:

	strncpy(new, old, cp-old);

is undefined behavior (even when cp == old == NULL in that case),
therefore gcc assumes that old is never NULL, as otherwise it would be
invalid.

Just guard
	strncpy(new, old, cp-old);
	new[cp-old] = 0;
with if (old) { ... }."

This patch does that. If old is NULL though, then we still need to
ensure that new is NULL terminated, lest the subsequent strcats walk off
the end of it.
