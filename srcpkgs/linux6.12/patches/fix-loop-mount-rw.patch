Subject: loop: don't require ->write_iter for writable files in loop_configure

Block devices can be opened read-write even if they can't be written to
for historic reasons.  Remove the check requiring file->f_op->write_iter
when the block devices was opened in loop_configure. The call to
loop_check_backing_file just below ensures the ->write_iter is present
for backing files opened for writing, which is the only check that is
actually needed.
