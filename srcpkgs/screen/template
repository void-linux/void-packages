long_desc="
 Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal
 between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each virtual
 terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition,
 several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022
 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).
 There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a
 copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between
 windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it
 (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use
 the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can create new
 (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells),
 kill the current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output
 logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback history,
 switch between windows, etc. All windows run their programs completely
 independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their window is
 currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached
 from the users terminal."
