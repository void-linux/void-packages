# This could be done with build options, but these are built in with the
# following justification.
#   * bindata: running with things not all in the binary is not a
#     supported distribution format by the gitea upstream developers.
#     That mode is only supported for development of gitea within the
#     source tree
#   * sqlite: this is likely the database that everyone will use.  Only
#     particularly large installations will want to go through the
#     effort of setting up a real database server.
#   * pam: PAM allows for authentication to varied external sources.
#     Internal authentication supports the local database, OpenID, and
#     LDAP, but basic other auth sources such as Kerberos and more
#     exotic authenticators require PAM support to be useable.
#   * tidb: This is an alternate database engine for users who would
#     rather not use SQLite3 for some reason.  It is also potentially
#     more resiliant to corrupted writes.
