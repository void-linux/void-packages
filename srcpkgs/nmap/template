long_desc="
 Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open source utility for network discovery
 and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it
 useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules,
 and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to
 determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
 name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS
 versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and
 dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,
 but works fine against single hosts."
