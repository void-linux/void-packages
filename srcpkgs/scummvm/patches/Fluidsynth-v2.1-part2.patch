Subject: [PATCH] AUDIO: Really Fix Compilation Against Fluidsynth v2.1+

The previous fix did not work as the forbidden exception had no effect
since scummsys.h and thus forbidden.h had already been included prior
to the fluidsynth header being included. This also meant that undefining
the exception define after the header would have had no effect anyway.

This new solution was suggest by eriktorbjorn on bug #11278 and should
avoid the need to add an exception which would persist over the entire
source file.
