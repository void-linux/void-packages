To start the Minecraft launcher a java implementation is required,
right now you can install the Open Java Runtime (openjdk-jre) or
the Oracle propietary "oracle-jre" package available
in the nonfree repository; alternatively you can also use your own
and make sure that "java" executable is in your PATH.
