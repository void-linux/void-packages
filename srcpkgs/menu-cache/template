long_desc="
 menu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed up the
 manipulation for freedesktop.org defined application menus. It can be used
 as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus.

 * Shorten time for loading menu entries.
 * Ease of use. (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu)
 * Lightweight runtime library. (Parsing of the menu definition files
   are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed.)
 * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
 * Heavily reduced disk I/O."
