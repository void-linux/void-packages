+
+	* NEWS: Accidentally forgot to back out the sorted wildcard
+	enhancement in 3.82, so update NEWS.
+	Also add NEWS about the error check for explicit and pattern
+	targets in the same rule, added to 3.82.
+
+	* main.c (main): Add "oneshell" to $(.FEATURES) (forgot to add
+	this in 3.82!)
+
+	* read.c (parse_file_seq): Fix various errors parsing archives
+	with multiple objects in the parenthesis, as well as wildcards.
+	Fixes Savannah bug #30612.

+	* main.c (main): Expand MAKEFLAGS before adding it to the
+	environment when re-exec'ing.  Fixes Savannah bug #30723.

 * WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
+  Wildcards were not documented as returning sorted values, but the results

+
+* WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
+  In previous versions of make it was acceptable to list one or more explicit
+  targets followed by one or more pattern targets in the same rule and it
+  worked "as expected".  However, this was not documented as acceptable and if
+  you listed any explicit targets AFTER the pattern targets, the entire rule
+  would be mis-parsed.  This release removes this ability completely: make
+  will generate an error message if you mix explicit and pattern targets in
+  the same rule.

+* WARNING: Backward-incompatibility!
   As a result of parser enhancements, three backward-compatibility issues
   exist: first, a prerequisite containing an "=" cannot be escaped with a
   backslash any longer.  You must create a variable containing an "=" and
