# REMARKS: Per request from Vaelatern this comment explains the hard
# depends on perl.  A direct dependency is noted on perl as
# asciiquarium is a perl executable and as stated in the manual,
# executables that require direct dependencies that are not detectable
# by xbps should have such dependencies listed in the 'depends' field.
