Subject: [PATCH 16/62] alsa: Cover the 'Int Mic Boost' element.

This is not 100% ideal as we have not way to tie specific boosts to specific
inputs and this particular chipset (as noted in #772) appears to
support just that.

For the time being incorporate it into the normal boost logic.

See http://pulseaudio.org/ticket/772
