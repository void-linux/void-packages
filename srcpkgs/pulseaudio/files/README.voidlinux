The system service `/etc/sv/pulseaudio` provided by the pulseaudio package is
only needed in rare cases and should be avoided in most setups for performance
and security reasons.

Optional dependencies:

* `python3-PyQt5-dbus` for running `qpaeq`
* `gst-plugins-bad1` and `libopenaptx` for aptX support
