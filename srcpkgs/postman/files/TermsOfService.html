If you exceed the number of User subscriptions purchased, you may be charged additional fees, including as set forth in our <a href="https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auto-Flex Policy</a>.</p><h3>3.4 The Postman API</h3><p>Your Account may be accessible via the  Postman application programming interface ("Postman API").

You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered Postman's confidential information (collectively, "Confidential Information"), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the "Purpose"), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don't otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a Postman-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).</p><p><strong>3.5.2.2</strong> Exceptions. Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of these Terms through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from Postman. You will not violate these Terms if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided Postman has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section style="background-color:;padding:0" class="leftTitleWithText__Section-sc-12ozlzh-0 exFfEC"><div class="container"><div class="row mb-3"><div class="col-12 text-left "><h2 class="mb-4" id="">4.

You agree that you are solely responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

By making your workspace, collections, or documentation public, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your APIs, collections, environments, mocks, monitors, and other linked entities because they become publicly accessible through your workspace, collections, or documentation. This means that others may make their own copies of Content from your workspaces, collections, or documentation in workspaces they control. If you set any of your workspaces, collections, documentation and/or entities to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of Postman a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Services and to reproduce such Content solely on the Services as permitted through the Services' functionality (for example, through forking).

Fees and Payment</h2><div><h3>7.1 Fees</h3><p>Your use of the Services is subject to you paying Postman the fees applicable to the Services plan selected and/or used by you ("Subscription Fee").  The Subscription Fees, permitted usage, and available features for each Services plan are listed at <a href="/pricing/">postman.com/pricing</a> (the "Pricing").</p><p>You will pay all fees in United States Dollars per the payment terms on an Order or otherwise agreed at the time of purchase. The amount of fees payable by you shall vary depending upon the number of Users and the period for which you are authorized to Use the Services ("Subscription Term").  Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in these Terms, fees paid are non-refundable.  In making payment, you acknowledge and agree that you are not relying on being able to Use the Services beyond the Subscription Term or on the availability of any future enhancements or upgrades.  If you fail to pay any fees on time, Postman reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) suspend or terminate the applicable Services.  If you add Users during a Subscription Term, such subscriptions will be billed at the then-current rate listed in the Pricing for your Services plan, and shall be co-termed through the end of the applicable Subscription Term, as further described in our <a href="https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auto-Flex Policy</a>.  If you make any purchases through a reseller ("Reseller"), you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that we may terminate your right to Use the Services if we do not receive our corresponding payment from the Reseller. </p><p>Except as otherwise specified in an Order, all subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term (and you will be charged at the then-current rates set forth in the Pricing) unless you cancel auto-renewal of your subscription through your Account at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term. If you cancel auto-renewal, your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle, or immediately if you so choose, however you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.</p><h3>7.2 Taxes</h3><p>Our fees are exclusive of all taxes that are payable in respect of the Services or its Use in the jurisdiction in which the payment is either made or received ("Taxes"). To the extent that any Taxes may be payable, you must pay Postman the amount of such Taxes in addition to any Subscription Fees owed by you hereunder. Any applicable tax-exempt certificates must be provided to Postman, who will make reasonable efforts to provide you with such invoicing documents as may enable you to seek an applicable refund or credit for the amount of Taxes so paid from any relevant revenue authority.</p><h3>7.3 Payment by Credit Card</h3><p>When you purchase a subscription ("Purchase"), you expressly authorize Postman (or our third party payment processor) to charge you the Subscription Fee (at the then-current Pricing) and Taxes, as follows:  (i) monthly in advance for monthly plans, (ii) annually in advance for annual plans, and (iii) in accordance with the <a href="https://learning.postman.com/auto-flex-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auto-Flex Policy</a> for additional Users you add during an existing Subscription Term.   Subscription Fees are subject to change, although Postman will notify you in advance of any such change.</p><p>Postman may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Purchase, including your credit card number and expiration date, and your billing address (such information, "Payment Information").  You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information.  When you initiate a Purchase, you authorize Postman to provide your Payment Information to our third party service providers so Postman can complete your Purchase and to charge your payment method for the type of Purchase you have selected (plus any Taxes and other applicable charges).</p><h3>7.4 Authorization for Recurring Payments</h3><p>By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a subscription, you acknowledge that your subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation or termination of your subscription by you or Postman. Postman (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with your Subscription Term (e.g., each month or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription Term, using the Payment Information you have provided. In the event your Subscription Term begins on a day not contained in a given month, your payment method will be charged on such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started a monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date. Your subscription continues until cancelled by you or Postman terminates your access to or use of the Services or the subscription in accordance with these Terms.  You will pay all fees in United States Dollars per the payment terms on an Order or as otherwise agreed at the time of purchase.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div><section style="background-color:;padding:0" class="leftTitleWithText__Section-sc-12ozlzh-0 exFfEC"><div class="container"><div class="row mb-3"><div class="col-12 text-left "><h2 class="mb-4" id="">8.

Indemnity and Liability</h2><div><h3>11.1 Indemnification by Postman</h3><p>Postman will defend you from any claim made by a third party that the Services infringe or misappropriate any copyright, trade secret, United States patent, or trademark right of that third party (a "Claim"), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in a settlement by Postman (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of a Claim, provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the Claim, including providing us a copy of the Claim and all relevant evidence in your possession, custody or control; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim, provided that we will not settle any Claim unless the settlement unconditionally releases you of all liability. If your use of the Services is (or in our opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (i) procure a license for your continued use of the Services in accordance with these Terms; (ii) substitute a substantially functionally similar Service; or (iii) terminate your right to continue using the Services and refund any prepaid, unused Subscription Fees applicable to the remaining portion of your Subscription Term. Postman\u2019s indemnification obligations above do not apply: (1) to any Services provided to you free of charge, (2) if the Services are modified by any party other than Postman, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the Services are used in combination with any non-Postman product, software or equipment, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of the Services; (5) to any Content or any Claim arising as a result of Content; or (6) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a Claim without Postman's prior written consent. THIS SECTION 11.1 (INDEMNIFICATION BY POSTMAN) STATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SERVICES, CONTENT OR OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED BY POSTMAN UNDER THESE TERMS.</p><h3>11.2 Indemnification by You</h3><p>You will defend Postman from any claim made by a third party in connection with any Content uploaded or generated by you or your Users in your Use of the Services, and you will indemnify and hold Postman harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to in a settlement by you (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of such a claim, provided that you have received from us: (a) prompt written notice of the claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the claim, including providing you a copy of the claim and all relevant evidence in our possession, custody or control (at your request and expense); and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the claim, provided that you may not settle any claim unless the settlement unconditionally releases Postman of all liability.</p><h3>11.3 Limitation of Liability</h3><p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT POSTMAN, ITS REPRESENTATIVES, AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF INCOME OR PROFIT, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY LOSS OR DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER OR NOT POSTMAN OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING. EXCEPT IN CASE OF YOUR VIOLATION OF THE  RESTRICTIONS IN SECTION 8, NEITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER SHALL EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO POSTMAN IN THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
