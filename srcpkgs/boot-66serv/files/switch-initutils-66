# This oneshot service checks for /usr/bin/{reboot,poweroff,halt,shutdown}
# and if they are part of runit-void it renames them and copies the 66
# utilities in their place. It must be enabled, especially if one
# changes between the two init systems. There is a similar script for
# runit core-services that does the opposite and runs by default with runit.
# The service makes sure that the user has the proper utilities for the
# init system they are currently running.
