Problem description: Tab-titles that are too long to fit into a tab get faded out.
                     On big endian this is broken and instead of fading out, the 
                     tab gets white and the font transparent, leading to an unreadable
                     tab-title
Solution: This is not a real solution, but a hack. The real solution would have been
          to byte-swap the correct buffer, but I could not find it.
          So the next best thing is to deactivate the fading-effect. Now all tab-titles
          are readable, albeit not as pretty to look at as they could be. 
Side-effects: I have not yet found an unwanted side-effect.
