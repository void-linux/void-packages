long_desc="
 QPDF is a command-line program that does structural, content-preserving
 transformations on PDF files. It could have been called something like
 pdf-to-pdf. It also provides many useful capabilities to developers of
 PDF-producing software or for people who just want to look at the innards
 of a PDF file to learn more about how they work."
