 FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC is
 similar to MP3, but lossless. The FLAC project consists of:
  * the stream format
  * libFLAC, which implements reference encoders and decoders
  * flac, a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode and decode .flac
    files
  * input plugins for various music players (Winamp, XMMS, and more in the
    works)

Free means that the specification of the stream format is in the public
domain (the FLAC project reserves the right to set the FLAC specification
and certify compliance), and that neither the FLAC format nor any of the
implemented encoding/decoding methods are covered by any patent. It also
means that the source for libFLAC is available under the LGPL and the
sources for flac and the plugins are available under the GPL."
