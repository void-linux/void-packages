Subject: [PATCH] 49bluetooth: Wait for btusb module to get unused

The 49bluetooth hook disables /proc/acpi/ibm/bluetooth but this isn't
synchronous, i. e. it doesn't wait until the module usage count actually drops
to 0. Due to that, it's impossible to add btusb to SUSPEND_MODULES (on some
models/older kernels you need to do that to fix suspend problems), as at that
point the module is still in use.

On my system (ThinkPad X201) the module takes between 0.3 and 0.5 seconds to
unload, so use 100 ms wait steps with a timeout of 2 seconds.
