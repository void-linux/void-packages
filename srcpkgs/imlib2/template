 Imlib 2 is the successor to Imlib. It is NOT a newer version - it is a
 completely new library. Imlib 2 can be installed alongside Imlib 1.x
 without any problems since they are effectively different libraries - BUT
 they have very similar functionality.

 Imlib 2 does the following:

  * Load/Save image files from disk in one of many formats
  * Render image data onto other images or an X-Windows drawable
  * Produce pixmaps and pixmap masks of Images
  * Apply filters and transformations to images
  * Accept RGBA Data for images and apply colour correction/modifications
  * Alpha blend Images on other images or drawables
  * Render truetype anti-aliased text straight and at angles
  * Render rectangles, anti-aliased lines, and multi-coloured gradients
  * Cache data intelligently for maximum performance
  * Allocate colours automatically
  * Allow full control over caching and color allocation
  * Provide highly optimized MMX assembly for core routines
  * Provide plug-in filter interface
  * Provide on-the-fly runtime plug-in image loading and saving interface
  * Fastest image compositing, rendering and manipulation library for X"
