long_desc="
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up common
 printers for use with Linux (and other operating systems). It provides the
 "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and your actual printer,
 by telling your computer how to process files sent to the printer.

 This package consists of filters used by the printer spoolers to convert the
 incoming PostScript data into the printer's native format using a
 printer-specific, but spooler-independent PPD file.

 For use with CUPS, you will need the cups package installed on your system."
