Subject: [PATCH] ServiceWorker: Avoid double destruction of
 ServiceWorkerObjectHost on connection error

This CL avoids the case where ServiceWorkerObjectHost is destroyed twice
on ServiceWorkerObjectHost::OnConnectionError() when Chromium is built
with the GCC build toolchain.

> How does the issue happen?

ServiceWorkerObjectHost has a cyclic reference like this:

ServiceWorkerObjectHost
  --([1] scoped_refptr)--> ServiceWorkerVersion
    --([2] std::unique_ptr)--> ServiceWorkerProviderHost
      --([3] std::unique_ptr)--> ServiceWorkerContainerHost
        --([4] std::unique_ptr)--> ServiceWorkerObjectHost

Note that ServiceWorkerContainerHost manages ServiceWorkerObjectHost in
map<int64_t version_id, std::unique_ptr<ServiceWorkerObjectHost>>.

When ServiceWorkerObjectHost::OnConnectionError() is called, the
function removes the reference [4] from the map, and destroys
ServiceWorkerObjectHost. If the object host has the last reference [1]
to ServiceWorkerVersion, the destruction also cuts off the references
[2] and [3], and destroys ServiceWorkerProviderHost and
ServiceWorkerContainerHost.

This seems to work well on the Chromium's default toolchain, but not
work on the GCC toolchain. According to the report, destruction of
ServiceWorkerContainerHost happens while the map owned by the container
host is erasing the ServiceWorkerObjectHost, and this results in crash
due to double destruction of the object host.

I don't know the reason why this happens only on the GCC toolchain, but
I suspect the order of object destruction on std::map::erase() could be
different depending on the toolchains.

> How does this CL fix this?

The ideal fix is to redesign the ownership model of
ServiceWorkerVersion, but it's not feasible in the short term.

Instead, this CL avoids destruction of ServiceWorkerObjectHost on
std::map::erase(). The new code takes the ownership of the object host
from the map first, and then erases the entry from the map. This
separates timings to erase the map entry and to destroy the object host,
so the crash should no longer happen.
