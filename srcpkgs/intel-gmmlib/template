# We could add -DGMMLIB_ARCH=generic to make it use -march=generic
# instead of their default of 'corei7', but it isn't necessary:
# the baseline of CPUs supported by gmmlib all fit under 'corei7'.
# They also add many '-msse*' flags, but they are all supported
# as well. Since this library isn't a dependency for anything but
# intel-media-driver, which is wholly optional and installed only on
# systems with supported CPUs, it doesn't make sense to change the
# compilers flag in use.
