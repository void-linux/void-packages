long_desc="
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading and
 writing Turtle and NTriples.

 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather is
 suited to resource limited or performance critical applications, or
 situations where a simple reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal
 (e.g. in LV2 hosts or plugins)."
