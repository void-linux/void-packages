# Options for the kernel hook script installed by the efibootmgr package.
#
# Allow efibootmgr to update kernels and initramfs in the EFI partition.
# This will keep two kernels and initramfs, the most recently configured
# version will be vmlinuz-A.efi and initramfs-A.img while your previously
# configured kernel and initramfs will be vmlinuz-B.efi and initramfs-B.img.
# This does NOT modify efi entries, you must add one for kernel A and B with
# efibootmgr(1).
# UPDATE_KERNELS=yes
