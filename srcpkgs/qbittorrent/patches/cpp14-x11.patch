Fix a SEGFAULT in qbittorrent when opening with existing torrents 
or when adding a new torrent.
qbittorrent is compiled using -std=c++11 but boost and libtorrent-rasterbar 
are compiled with whatever gcc uses as default and that seems to have switched
recently to c++14 in Void.
However switching below option to c++14 actually adds the 
compile flag -std=g++1y which is a gnu variant of c++14 I am not sure if that
causes another trouble later.
Let's just mimic what the other packages do: do not set the support level 
and let the compiler handle it.
PS: src/CMakeList.txt sets the support level based on compiler support but Void
builds using qmake instead of cmake.
