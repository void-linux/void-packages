    tests/common: fix " 37 has function" test on musl systems.
    
    This commit fixes the test that asserts on whether the lchmod() function
    should have been detected as available by Meson. It does so by assuming
    that on Linux systems not using glibc, the function will be available.
    
    - fix comment about lchmod on Linux: musl has implemented the function
    correctly since 2013, so the assumption in the test wasn't correct.
    Furthermore, musl doesn't use glibc's stub mechanism.
    - fix include to receive __GLIBC__ definition: including almost any
    header in glibc will end up defining __GLIBC__, since most headers
    include <features.h>. The <gnu/libc-version.h> header was probably
    chosen because of its name, but its actual purpose is defining functions
    for checking glibc version at runtime (instead of what the binary was
    built with), so it isn't necessary to use it. Since it is a completely
    non standard header, including it makes the test suite fail on musl due
    to not finding the header.
