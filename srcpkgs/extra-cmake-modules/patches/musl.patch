Subject: [PATCH] KDECompilerSettings: Ensure POSIX correctness

This change ensures that _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined.  Since we use -std=
iso9899:1990, GCC and Clang won't enable this definition by default.
On non-glibc systems (where _GNU_SOURCE isn't defined), this causes most
POSIX interfaces to be missing, which cause various build failures.
