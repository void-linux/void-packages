 mcpp is a C/C++ preprocessor with the following features:

 * Implements all of C90, C99 and C++98 specifications.
 * Provides a validation suite to test C/C++ preprocessor's conformance and
   quality comprehensively. When this validation suite is applied, mcpp
   distinguishes itself among many existing preprocessors.
 * Has plentiful and on-target diagnostics to check all the preprocessing
   problems such as latent bug or lack of portability in source code.
 * Has #pragma directives to output debugging information.
 * Is portable and has been ported to many compiler-systems, including GCC
   and Visual C++, on UNIX-like systems and Windows.
 * Has various behavior modes.
 * Can be built either as a compiler-specific preprocessor to replace the
   resident preprocessor of a particular compiler system, or as a
   compiler-independent command, or even as a subroutine called from some
   other main program.
 * Provides comprehensive documents both in Japanese and in English.
 * Is an open source software released under BSD-style-license.
 * It is probably number one C/C++ preprocessor now available in the world."
