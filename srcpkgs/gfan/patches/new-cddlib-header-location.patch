 As an alternative to using package managers as above you can try to locate an executable file named ``gfan'' in the installation of other math software. SageMath, for example, contains a gfan executable. You also have the possibility of installing a precompiled executables: go to the Gfan webpage, go to the binaries.html subpage, and follow the instructions there. There is however only very few executables available.

-%% The apt-get linux trouble disappears if all includes of cdd files are of form ``cdd/set\_oper.h''. Now of course if we cannot run apt-get because we are not root we need to install cddlib manually. Here we should use configure to specify how that is done correctly. We should use --prefix=, --includedir=, and possibly --libdir=.
