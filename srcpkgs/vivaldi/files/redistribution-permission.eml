Hello Abby,

Thank you for reaching out and your interest in distributing Vivaldi.
Yes, please feel free to distribute Vivaldi as an unrestricted package.

We are excited to see that more Void linux user will discover and try Vivaldi.

If you need any other assistance, please let us know.

Kind regards,
Tatsuki
