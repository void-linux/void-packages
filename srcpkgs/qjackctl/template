long_desc="
 QjackCtl is a simple Qt application to control the JACK sound server daemon,
 specific for the Linux Audio Desktop infrastructure.

 Written in C++ around the Qt4 toolkit for X11, most exclusively using
 Qt Designer.

 Provides a simple GUI dialog for setting several JACK daemon parameters, which
 are properly saved between sessions, and a way control of the status of the
 audio server daemon. With time, this primordial interface has become richer by
 including a enhanced patchbay and connection control features."
