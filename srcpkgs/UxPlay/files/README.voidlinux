Additional GStreamer plugins you may need to install:
- `gstreamer-vaapi` is needed for hardware-accelerated h264 video decoding by Intel or AMD graphics (but not for use with NVIDIA using proprietary drivers)
- `gstreamer1-pipewire` may be needed for audio sharing when your system is set up to use pipewire

Additionally, UxPlay requires a running DNS-SD server (for example `avahi`).
