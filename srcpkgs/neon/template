 Features:

  * High-level wrappers for common HTTP and WebDAV operations
    (GET, MOVE, DELETE, etc)
  * Low-level interface to the HTTP request/response engine, allowing the use
    of arbitrary HTTP methods, headers, etc.
  * Authentication support including Basic and Digest support, along with
    GSSAPI-based Negotiate on Unix, and SSPI-based Negotiate/NTLM on Win32
  * SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL or GnuTLS; exposing an abstraction layer
    for verifying server certificates, handling client certificates, and
    examining certificate properties. Smartcard-based client certificates are
    also supported via a PKCS#11 wrapper interface.
  * Abstract interface to parsing XML using libxml2 or expat, and wrappers for
    simplifying handling XML HTTP response bodies
  * WebDAV metadata support; wrappers for PROPFIND and PROPPATCH to simplify
    property manipulation."
