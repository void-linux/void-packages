nextcloud-client-kwallet package provides a wrapper of nextcloud-client.
It enforces nextcloud-client to use kwallet as its credential storage.
This is usefull when user's desktop environment is not KDE/plasma.

Nextcloud-client relies on qtkeychain to choose an appropriate storage backend.
But qtkeychain chooses kwallet over gnome-keyring only if the DE is KDE/Plasma.
