/usr/bin/nextcloud.kwallet is a wrapper to enforce kwallet as credential
storage.  This is usefull when user's desktop environment is not KDE/plasma.

Nextcloud-client relies on qtkeychain to choose an appropriate storage backend.
But qtkeychain chooses kwallet over gnome-keyring only if the DE is KDE/Plasma.
