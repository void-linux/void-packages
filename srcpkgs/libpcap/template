long_desc="
 This is libpcap, a system-independent interface for user-level packet
 capture. libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
 monitoring. Applications include network statistics collection,
 security monitoring, network debugging, etc. Since almost every
 system vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, and
 since we've developed several tools that require this functionality,
 we've created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
 alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
 in each application."
