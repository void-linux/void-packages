# This is an example configuration file for spacenavd. Uncomment and change
# any settings you need and copy it to /etc/spnavrc.
#
# Note that it's much easier to configure sensitivities and figure out axis
# reversals by using the interactive configure utility "spnavcfg", which lets
# you fiddle with all the settings and see the result immediately.

# Lines that start with a `#' are comments, and are ignored by spacenavd.


# Sensitivity is multiplied with every motion (1.0 normal).

#sensitivity = 1.0

# Separate sensitivity for rotation and translation.

# Separate sensitivity for each roation and translation axis.
#
#sensitivity-translation-x = 1.0
#sensitivity-translation-y = 1.0
#sensitivity-translation-z = 1.0

# Axis remapping (zero-based)
#
#axismap0 = 0

# Button remapping (zero-based)
#
#bnmap0 = 0
#bnmap1 = 1
#...
#bnmapN = N  (N < 64)


# Map buttons to keyboard keys (experimental)
# By default no such mappings are active. Use the following syntax:
#    kbmapN = <keysym>
# where N is the button number (zero-based), and <keysym> is a keysym name from
# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, without the leading XK_
# Example:
#    kbmap0 = Escape


# Serial device
# Set this only if you have a serial device, and make sure you specify the
# correct device file. If you do set this option, any USB devices will be
# ignored!
#
#serial = /dev/ttyS0


# Enable/disable LED light (for devices that have one).
#
#led = on


# Device grab (USB)
#
# When set to true (default): grab the USB device to prevent other programs
# (such as the X server) from also using it.
#
# Grabbing the device ensures that other programs won't be able to use it without
# talking to spacenavd. For instance some versions of Xorg will use the device to move
# the mouse pointer if we don't grab it.
# Set this to false if you want to use programs that try to talk to the device directly
# such as google earth, then follow FAQ 11 http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/faq.html#faq11
# to force the X server to ignore the device
#
#grab = true


# List of additional USB devices to use (multiple devices can be listed)
#
# example:
#    device-id = 046d:c625


# Repeat interval (milliseconds)
# Non-deadzone events are repeated every so many milliseconds (-1 to disable).
#
# You probably don't need this setting. Set it to something like 250 if you
# find that your apps stop moving the view while you hold the puck/ball at a
# fixed off-center position (like bottomed out on the vertical axis).
# Might cause inadvertent continuous motion if the deadzone is too small for
# the re-centering power of the device.
#
#repeat-interval = -1


# Log file path
#
#logfile = /var/log/spnavd.log

# Log targets
#
# Valid options are:
#  - file: log messages to a file defined by the logfile option.
#  - syslog: log messages to the system logging daemon.
# Combine multiple options by listing them on the same line.
