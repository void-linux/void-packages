# Sometimes when starting the keyd service, the keyboard can become unresponsive.
# This is the result of keyd starting when the early udevd process is still running but
# before the udevd runit service has started. The udevd runit service kills the early udevd
# process causing the keyboard to become unresponsive until the keyd process has been
# terminated. The below code verifies that the supervised udevd process is the same as
# the currently running udevd process.
