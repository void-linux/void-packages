long_desc="
 Debian Almquist shell (dash) is a POSIX-compliant Unix shell, much smaller
 than bash. It requires less disk space but is also less feature rich.

 Dash is a direct descendant of the NetBSD version of the Almquist Shell
 (ash). It was ported to Linux by Herbert Xu in early 1997. It was renamed to
 dash in 2002."
