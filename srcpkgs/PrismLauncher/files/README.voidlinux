Void-specific instructions:
============================

You may not have the correct version of java installed for running specific
versions of Minecraft. For Minecraft version 1.17 and up install openjdk17-jre
and for older ones openjdk8-jre.

If you get an error message that includes "org.lwjgl.opengl.LinuxDisplay.getAvailableDisplayModes",
you may need to install xrandr.
