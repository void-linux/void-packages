long_desc="
 Irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text mode user
 interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific, so other UIs
 could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't really even IRC specific
 anymore, there's already a working SILC module available. Support for other
 protocols like ICQ could be created some day too."
