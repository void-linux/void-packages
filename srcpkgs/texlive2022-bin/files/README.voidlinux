  To update your TeX Live installation use only the program 

  /opt/texlive/2022/bin/<arch>/tlmgr

  where <arch> is:
    - x86_64-linux  ==> x86_64 architecture
    - i386-linux    ==> i386 architecture

  for details see:
  http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#EXAMPLES
    		 		 
  WARNING: To avoid messing up your TeX Live installation, DON'T use
  the installation scripts in /opt/texlive-installer.

  This package only installs TeX Live infrastructure now, not TeX Live itself.
  For a basic installation (previous default), run "tlmgr install scheme-basic".
  For a full installation, run "tlmgr install scheme-full".
