Subject: [PATCH 1/1] build: unbreak C++ binding compilation with newer Doxygen
 (1.8.16)

Doxygen version 1.8.16 introduced an issue which breaks the compilation
of sigrok's C++ binding (https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/7190).
Don't set the FILE_PATTERNS variable at all, instead of assigning an
empty value. This resolves bug #1422.
