 This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes support
 to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs support
 this includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, either
 at parse time or later once the document has been modified. The output
 can be a simple SAX stream or and in-memory DOM like representations.
 In this case one can use the built-in XPath and XPointer implementation
 to select subnodes or ranges. A flexible Input/Output mechanism is
 available, with existing HTTP and FTP modules and combined to an
 URI library."
