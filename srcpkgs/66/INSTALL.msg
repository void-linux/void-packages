CAUTION: package revision 0.6.1.1_2 changes the default system-dir
from /var/lib/66 to /etc/66/lib. The change requires user intervention.
Users who upgrade from an earlier version should either copy the 
contents of the old dir to the new one after installation, or re-create
trees and re-enable services. That should be done before rebooting/halting
the system.
