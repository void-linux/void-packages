# the X13s' wlan and bluetooth firmware/hardware do not support
# storing their default MAC address, so it must be set on boot
# by default, these are set to a random MAC address with the
# correct vendor prefix (OUI) of F4:A0:0D. These MAC addresses
# can also be assigned manually by editing this file.
