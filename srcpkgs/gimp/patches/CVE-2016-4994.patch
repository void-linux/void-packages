Subject: Bug 767873 - (CVE-2016-4994) Multiple Use-After-Free when parsing...

...XCF channel and layer properties

The properties PROP_ACTIVE_LAYER, PROP_FLOATING_SELECTION,
PROP_ACTIVE_CHANNEL saves the current object pointer the @info
structure. Others like PROP_SELECTION (for channel) and
PROP_GROUP_ITEM (for layer) will delete the current object and create
a new object, leaving the pointers in @info invalid (dangling).

Therefore, if a property from the first type will come before the
second, the result will be an UaF in the last lines of xcf_load_image
(when it actually using the pointers from @info).

I wasn't able to exploit this bug because that
g_object_instance->c_class gets cleared by the last g_object_unref and
GIMP_IS_{LAYER,CHANNEL} detects that and return FALSE.
