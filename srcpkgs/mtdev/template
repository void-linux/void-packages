 The mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of kernel MT
 events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev may be from
 any MT device, specifically type A without contact tracking, type A with
 contact tracking, or type B with contact tracking.

 The bulk of the mtdev code has been out there since 2008, as part of the
 Multitouch X Driver. With this package, finger tracking and seamless MT
 protocol handling is available under a free license."
