    rockchip: Pinebook Pro: fix mmc boot ordering
    
    On the Pinebook Pro, and perhaps some other boards, the mmc indices are
    opposite from what is implied by the comment in
    include/configs/rockchip-common.h.
    
    This commit fixes the boot ordering to prioritize the SD card over eMMC.
    
    Most distributions of U-Boot that actually target rk3399 boards apply a
    similar patch, such as Manjaro (shipped by default on PBP) and armbian.
