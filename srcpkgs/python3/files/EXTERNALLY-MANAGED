 This system-wide Python installation is managed by the Void Linux package
 manager, XBPS. Installation of Python packages from other sources is not
 normally allowed.

 To install a Python package not offered by Void Linux, consider using a virtual
 environment, e.g.:

   python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
   /path/to/venv/pip install <package>

 Appending the flag --system-site-packages to the first command will give the
 virtual environment access to any Python package installed via XBPS.

 Invoking python, pip, and executables installed by pip in /path/to/venv/bin
 should automatically use the virtual environment. Alternatively, source its
 activation script to add the environment to the command search path for a shell:

   . /path/to/venv/activate

 After activation, running

   deactivate

 will remove the environment from the search path without destroying it.

 The XBPS package python3-pipx provides pipx, a convenient tool to automatically
 manage virtual environments for individual Python applications.
