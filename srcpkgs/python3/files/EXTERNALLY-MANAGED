 The system-wide Python installation in Void should be maintained
 using the system package manager, xbps.

 If the package in question is not packaged for Void, please
 consider installing it inside a virtual environment, e.g.:

   python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
   . /path/to/venv/bin/activate
   pip install mypackage

 To exit the virtual environment, run:

   deactivate

 The virtual environment is not deleted, and can be re-entered by
 re-sourcing the activate file.

 To automatically manage virtual environments, pipx (from python3-pipx)
 can be used.
