# REMARKS:
# Conf file is in a --sysconfdir=/etc/$pkgname/Muttrc and then alternatives to
# /etc/Muttrc. In addition, a dependency on mime-types is broken by having
# /etc/dir/ because mutt probably expects the mime information in the same
# dir as sysconfdir. Thus a symlink is created to deal with this.
# /etc/Muttrc is not currently in alternatives to prevent inadvertently
# overwriting configuration.
# In version 20160808 keybase integration was added, and lots of new
# documentation now gets installed. Rumors of an /etc/NeoMuttrc are in the
# release notes but not currently installed for unknown reasons.
# As of 20171013, neomutt has hard forked and no longer refers to itself as
# "Mutt" anywhere in the codebase. https://www.neomutt.org/2017/10/13/release
# /etc/neomuttrc now exists, and there are no conflicts with regular mutt.
# Due to this, an install.msg was added and all alternatives were removed.
# Cross compiling was fixed in 20180323
