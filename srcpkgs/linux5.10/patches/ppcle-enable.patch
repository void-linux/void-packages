These are experimental fixes for running 32-bit little endian binaries on
Linux/ppc64le. While this may seem pointless, it does work, does not break
anything, and may allow enablement of things we couldn't do before (e.g.
support for box86 and thus reasonably fast emulation of 32-bit x86 games).

The first part is a signal handler fix, the second part enables the 32-bit
VDSO by removing the ppc32/big endian restriction.
