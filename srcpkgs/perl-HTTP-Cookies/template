 This class is for objects that represent a cookie jar -- that is, a database
 of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows about.
 
 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html
 and http://www.cookiecentral.com/. This module also implements the new style
 cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed to be
 able to coexist happily.
 
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files."
