 GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP,
 HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a
 non-interactive commandline tool, so it may easily be called from scripts,
 cron jobs, terminals without X-Windows support, etc.

 GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring
 entire web or FTP sites easy, including:

    * Can resume aborted downloads, using REST and RANGE
    * Can use filename wild cards and recursively mirror directories
    * NLS-based message files for many different languages
    * Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative,
      so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally
    * Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows
    * Supports HTTP proxies and cookies
    * Supports persistent HTTP connections
    * Unattended / background operation
    * Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be
      re-downloaded when mirroring
    * GNU Wget is distributed under the GNU General Public License."
