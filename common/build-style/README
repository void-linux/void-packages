BUILD STYLES
============

These shell snippets provide support for multiple build systems, i.e GNU configure,
CMake, etc. A build style file must provide at least the following functions:

	- do_configure
	- do_build
	- do_install

If a source package defines its own do_xxx() function, the function defined in
the build style file is simply ignored.
