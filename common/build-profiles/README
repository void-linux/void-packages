BUILD PROFILES
==============

This directory contains build profiles to set properties on native builds
for a specific architecture:

	- XBPS_TRIPLET		(the compiler triplet)
	- XBPS_CFLAGS		(C compiler flags for host compiler)
	- XBPS_CXXFLAGS		(C++ compiler flags for the host compiler)
	- XBPS_FFLAGS		(Fortran compiler flags for the host compiler)
	- XBPS_RUST_TARGET	(the compiler triplet for usage by cargo)
	- XBPS_ZIG_TARGET	(the arch-os-abi target triplet for zig)
	- XBPS_ZIG_CPU		(the cpu/feature set for zig)

These properties are also set in a cross environment, but the compiler
flags are not added into the global flags. XBPS_RUST_TARGET is also
exposed as RUST_BUILD instead of RUST_TARGET.
