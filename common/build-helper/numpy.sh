# numpy - build-helper for packages that compile against python3-numpy
#
# This build-helper makes sure packages can find python3-numpy libraries and
# headers on the target architecture rather than the host, as well as making
# sure the gfortran cross compiler is properly identified.

# Even for cross compilation, numpy should be available on the host to ensure
# that the host interpreter doesn't complain about missing deps
