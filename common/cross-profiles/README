CROSS PROFILES
==============

This directory contains cross profiles to allow cross compilation for the specified target.
A cross profile file must provide the following variables:

	- XBPS_TARGET_ARCH	(as returned by uname -m)
	- XBPS_CROSS_TRIPLET	(the cross compiler triplet)
	- XBPS_CROSS_CFLAGS	(C compiler flags for the cross compiler)
	- XBPS_CROSS_CXXFLAGS	(C++ compiler flags for the cross compiler)
	- XBPS_CROSS_CPPFLAGS	(Preprocessor flags for the cross compiler)
	- XBPS_CROSS_LDFLAGS	(Linker flags for the cross compiler)

A source package matching `cross-${XBPS_CROSS_TRIPLET}' must also exist.
