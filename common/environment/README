ENVIRONMENT SHELL SNIPPETS
==========================

This directory contains shell files (must not be executable nor contain a shebang)
that are read by xbps-src when building source packages. The shell files
are read in lexical order (as ordered by shell rules).

These files shall set or unset environment variables while building packages.
Only files with the `.sh' extension are read, so this file will be simply ignored.

The following directories are used to set the order in which the shell snippets
should be read by xbps-src:

	* build-style	(to set vars for a specific build_style helper)
	* setup		(before reading template)
	* setup-subpkg	(before running the subpkg <pkgname>_package() function)
	* fetch		(before running fetch phase)
	* extract	(before running extract phase)
	* configure	(before running configure phase)
	* build		(before running build phase)
	* check		(before running check phase)
	* install	(before running install phase)
	* pkg		(before running pkg phase)

NOTES
~~~~~
* Symlinks can be created (relative) to make a shell snippet available in
  multiple phases.
