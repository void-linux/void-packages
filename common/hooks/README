HOOKS
=====

This directory contains shell hooks that are processed after or before the
specified phase. The shell hooks are simply shell snippets (must not be
executable nor contain a shebang) that are processed lexically by xbps-src.
Only files with the `.sh` extension are processed.

A shell hook must provide a `hook()` function which is the entry point to
execute it via xbps-src.

The following directories are used to set the order in which the hooks
should be processed by xbps-src:

	* pre-fetch		(before running fetch phase)
	* do-fetch		(running fetch phase)
	* post-fetch		(after running fetch phase)

	* pre-extract		(before running extract phase)
	* do-extract		(running extract phase)
	* post-extract		(after running extract phase)

	* pre-configure		(before running configure phase)
	* do-configure		(running configure phase)
	* post-configure	(after running configure phase)

	* pre-build		(before running build phase)
	* do-build		(running build phase)
	* post-build		(after running build phase)

	* pre-install		(before running install phase)
	* do-install		(running install phase)
	* post-install		(after running install phase)

	* pre-pkg		(before running pkg phase)
	* do-pkg		(running pkg phase)
	* post-pkg		(after running pkg phase)

NOTES
~~~~~
* Symlinks can be created (relative) to make a hook available in multiple phases.

* The phases do-fetch, do-extract, do-configure, do-build, and do-install can
  be overwritten by the template file. That means if a template contains a
  do_install function, the hooks defined for do-install won't be executed.
  Note that this is only true for the do-* hooks.

* the pre_* function of the template will be run *after* the corresponding
  pre-* hooks.

* the post_* function of the template will be run *before* the corresponding
  post-* hooks.
