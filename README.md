## The official source repository for voidlinux.

This repository contains the source package tree to build xbps binary
packages from sources for the Void Linux distribution.

To use this repository the 'xbps-src' utility is required. If you don't use
Void Linux you can fetch its sources from:

	https://github.com/xtraeme/xbps-src

Or alternatively if you are already using Void you can install
the binary package with:

	$ xbps-install -y xbps-src

Enjoy and happy hacking! meet us at xbps@irc.freenode.net.
