If GitHub CI cannot be used to validate the build result (for example, if the
build is likely to take several hours), make sure to
[skip CI](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#continuous-integration).
When skipping CI, uncomment and fill out the following section.
Note: for builds that are likely to complete in less than 2 hours, it is not
acceptable to skip CI.
